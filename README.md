### Expense Manager Web Application

I developed a comprehensive Expense Manager web application (named **Expense Desk** ) as my Graduation Final Year project back in year 2020. Powered by Python and Django for the backend, the application efficiently handles all business logic, while the frontend is done using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap and PostgreSQL ensures secure and organized data storage.

**Key Features:**
- **User-Friendly Expense Tracking:** Users can effortlessly log day-to-day expenses across various categories, including Shopping, Medical, Bills and Fees, Travel, Beauty, Food, Entertainment, and more.

- **Intelligent Graphical Representations:** The application provides insightful graphical representations of expenses based on Expense Type, Monthly, and Weekly breakdowns. This visual analysis aids users in understanding spending patterns and assists in budget management.

- **Data Security:** User credentials are prioritized, employing AES256 encryption for enhanced security, ensuring the protection of sensitive information.

- **Account Management:** Users can create accounts, log in securely, and leverage a password reset feature that sends reset instructions to registered emails.

This Expense Manager is designed to empower users with a simple yet effective tool to monitor their expenditures, offering valuable insights for better financial planning and management.
